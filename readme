This iOS Shortcut "APP" was inspired by my personal injury & recovery journey. Part of my early recovery process was understanding my current circumstances by way of symptoms, to better communicate these signals to my medical team. 
A daily bedtime symptom journal in iOS Notes. Date, Symptoms, Severity, and any therapeutics or prescriptions taken. 

This personal tracking routine helped me understand my body, helped me reflect on possible triggers for aggravating symptoms, and helped shed light on focus areas for treatment by my team of experts. 

FWIW: My Medical team was comprised of a General Practitioner, a Specialist (and Renowned researcher), a Neurologist (Neurology professor at a top Canadian institution) and one of the countries best Vestibular Physiotherapists. 

I Hope this helps others on their injury recovery journey.
